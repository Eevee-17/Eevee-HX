Eevee HX does require [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) to work properly.

This is just a fun project I'm working on to "hack" Minecraft. If you use Eevee HX, please refrain from using it on servers/realms without permissions from their respective owners(you don't want to ruin the Minecraft experience from other people). This was made to be played in singleplayer, but may work in servers.
